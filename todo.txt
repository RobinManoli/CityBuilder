update manoli.se favicon as it looks like a no-traffic sign

fix

tooltips/hover tile - give computer hints
	press v to select village tool
	double click to enable
	mouse "no" if cannot place building, or maybe text that says click to view info

clean up
	tooltips (commented code) - though might want hovering info with keyboard shortcuts
	bootstrap modal vanilla-js or bootstrap-vue

optimization
	removing garbage destroys the tile, but it still exists - upgrade to latest phaser?
	spritesheet
	test remove jquery if using bootstrap-vue

ipad acclimatization
	when creating toolkit, have drag in mind -- or when creating drag, remake toolkit
	add clickable objects before keyboard shortcuts
	drag tool to place it, but if it's difficult to drag don't place it - instead create a place tool with arrows around to easily move the placement to the side
	highlight selected tool
	click tool type to switch selected tool
